# Campus Marketplace & Resource Hub — Product Context

> **Purpose:** This document is the permanent source of truth for understanding the Campus Marketplace & Resource Hub product. Future development discussions should use this document as the baseline and should not introduce conflicting technology or product assumptions without explicitly discussing the change.

---

## 1. Product

### 1.1 Official Product Name
**Campus Marketplace & Resource Hub**

### 1.2 Short Name
**Campus Marketplace**

### 1.3 One-Line Description
A verified student-only web marketplace for college campuses to easily buy, sell, and rent academic resources and dorm essentials with zero travel friction.

### 1.4 What We Are Building
A verified, peer-to-peer web platform for college campuses that enables students to buy, sell, rent, and pass down academic resources and dorm essentials safely within their own institution or nearby verified partner colleges.

The product has two closely connected areas:

- **Marketplace:** Buying, selling, and renting physical campus-related items.
- **Resource Hub:** Sharing and discovering academic resources, including digital materials and physical academic assets.

### 1.5 Ultimate Vision
Build a fully working product that students across a city and eventually a country actively use for campus-to-campus buying, selling, renting, and resource sharing.

---

# 2. Problem

## 2.1 Problem Being Solved
College students lack a safe, centralized, organized platform to buy, sell, rent, or pass down semester-specific academic resources and hostel essentials directly to peers on campus.

Examples include textbooks, lab gear, calculators, hardware kits, dorm equipment, and other student-use items.

## 2.2 Current Alternatives
Students currently rely on:

- WhatsApp or Telegram batch groups
- Instagram stories
- OLX or Facebook Marketplace
- Word of mouth through roommates, classmates, and seniors

## 2.3 Problems With Existing Solutions

### Feed Clutter
WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram posts get buried quickly under other messages, leaving no persistent or searchable inventory.

### No Availability Tracking
Buyers may contact sellers only to discover that an item was already sold.

### Safety & Scams
Open marketplaces expose students to unverified strangers, scammers, and potentially unsafe off-campus meetups.

### Logistics Overhead
Public marketplaces can involve long-distance travel, shipping costs, or courier coordination for inexpensive items where delivery costs may exceed the item's value.

## 2.4 Why Campus-Specific?
Campus Marketplace is designed around the trust and logistics advantages of a verified campus network.

- **Institutional verification:** Users must authenticate using an approved institutional email domain.
- **Zero-shipping model:** Transactions are designed around convenient physical handovers at safe campus locations.
- **Structured discovery:** Listings can be searched and filtered by category, price, condition, course, semester, and campus scope.
- **Controlled expansion:** The MVP begins with one campus and can later expand to verified nearby partner campuses.

# 8. Technology Stack

## 8.1 Frontend
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript initially
- Tailwind CSS

## 8.2 Backend
- Python
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- SQLAlchemy or SQLModel

The exact ORM choice remains TBD and will be selected during implementation.

## 8.3 Database
**PostgreSQL via Supabase**

### Reason for PostgreSQL
The product has strongly relational data involving users, campuses, listings, categories, resources, reports, and roles. PostgreSQL provides a better long-term foundation than SQLite or MongoDB for this architecture.

SQLite is not the intended production database.

MongoDB is not part of the selected MVP architecture.

## 8.4 Authentication
**Supabase Auth**

Institutional email/domain validation will be enforced by the application.

The exact login mechanism (OTP or magic link) is an implementation decision.

## 8.5 Image Storage
**Cloudinary**

Used for product/listing images, including optimization and delivery.

## 8.6 Document/PDF Storage
**Supabase Storage**

Used for eligible academic documents/PDFs.

## 8.7 Hosting
### Frontend
Vercel preferred, with Netlify as an alternative.

### Backend
Render or Railway initially, depending on free-tier suitability at implementation time.

### Database & Storage
Supabase.

# 10. Design Principles

The product should feel:

- **Student-focused**
- **Fast**
- **Trustworthy**
- **Minimal**

## Student-Focused
The product should feel built by students for students rather than like a corporate classifieds portal.

Use terminology and categories that reflect real campus life.

## Fast
Browsing, searching, filtering, and campus switching should feel immediate.

Images should be optimized and backend/database queries should be efficient.

## Trustworthy
The UI should clearly communicate:

- Verified student status
- Institutional verification
- Seller campus
- Safe pickup expectations

## Minimal
Avoid:

- Unnecessary ads in the MVP
- Popups
- Visual clutter
- Excessive social features

The goal is to let a student find or list an item quickly.

## What the Product Should NOT Feel Like

### Not a generic enterprise portal
Avoid rigid, boring enterprise UI.

### Not OLX/Craigslist
Avoid clutter, banner-heavy layouts, spam-like listings, and visual chaos.

### Not social media
Avoid endless feeds and engagement mechanics unrelated to buying/selling/resource discovery.

## Visual Preferences
**TBD**

# 15. Product Development Rules

These rules should guide future development discussions:

1. **Do not introduce a new framework or service without a clear reason.**
2. **Do not replace PostgreSQL with MongoDB or SQLite for production without explicitly discussing the trade-off.**
3. **Do not replace FastAPI with Node.js/Express without an explicit architecture decision.**
4. **Keep the MVP lean.** Features listed as Phase 2+ should not be pulled into the MVP unless there is a deliberate decision to change scope.
5. **Prefer existing managed services over building infrastructure from scratch.**
6. **Prioritize student adoption, trust, speed, and simplicity.**
7. **Keep marketplace transactions off-platform during MVP.**
8. **Treat this document as the baseline.** If a future product decision changes something here, update the context/decision log rather than silently creating a conflicting implementation.
9. **Do not assume a feature is implemented just because it appears in this document.** Product requirements and current implementation status are separate.
10. **When making technical recommendations, optimize for a solo/small student team, an 8–12 week MVP timeline, and a $0 initial infrastructure budget.**

---
